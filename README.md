A Home Assistant integration that allows you to receive LoRaWAN device data from ChirpStack via HTTP integration.

## Features

* Creates devices with binary_sensors and sensors.
* Basic unit of measurement detection.
* Supports configuring multiple platforms / endpoints.
* Header authentication.

## Requirements

* Your home assistant http port to be accessible from chirpstack.
* Chirpstack needs to decode the uplink with a codec. This component does not support decoding.
